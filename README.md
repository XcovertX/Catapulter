# Catapulter

This is Catapulter, an ASCII based scifi semi-rouge-like. 

I was interested learning how to build a parser that can take in the casual user input
and extract the infomation to form accurate operative commands. Currently, the game is
just a shell with 10 or 15 rooms to navigate through. 

While I have built the parser (it can be viewed at: src/imputProcessor/InportProcessor.java),
this moment, there is nothing in the game that can be interacted with outside of navigation. 
This is due some changes that I am currently making to the in game object structures. 

I'll update this as soon as I add the objects into the game. 

Outside of all of that, I love SciFi and feel like it's under represented in the rouge-like / mud games. I aim to change that. ;)
